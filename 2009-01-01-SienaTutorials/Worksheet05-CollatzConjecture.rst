===================
The 3n+1 Conjecture
===================

.. MODULEAUTHOR:: Franco Saliola <saliola at gmail.com>

The `3n+1` conjecture is an unsolved conjecture in mathematics. It is
also known as the  *Collatz conjecture*, as the  *Ulam conjecture* (after
Stanislaw Ulam), or as the  *Syracuse problem*. *Lothar Collatz* was the first
person to propose the problem in 1937.

The 3n+1 operation
------------------

Consider the following operation on positive integers `n`.

- If `n` is even, then divide it by `2`.
- If `n` is odd, then multiply it by `3` and add `1`.

For example, if we apply this transformation to  `6` , then we get
`3`  since `6`  is even; and if we apply this operation to
`11` , then we get  `34` since  `11`  is odd.

**Exercises**

#. Write a function that implements this operation, and compute the images of
   `1, 2, \ldots 100`.

Statement of the conjecture
---------------------------

If we start with  `n=6`  and apply this operation, then we get  `3`.

If we now apply this operation to  `3`, then we get `10`.

Applying the operation to `10` outputs `5`.

Continuing in this way, we get a sequence of integers.

For example, starting with `n=6`, we get the sequence:

.. MATH::

   6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, \ldots

Notice that this sequence has entered the loop `4 \mapsto 2 \mapsto 1
\mapsto 4`. One formulation of the Collatz conjecture is the following.


    **3n+1 conjecture:**
        For every positive integer `n`, the resulting
        sequence will always reach the number `1`.

**Exercises**

#. Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the sequence
   until it reaches  `1` . For example, for ``6`` , your function will return
   ``[ 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 ]``. Find the largest values in the
   sequences for  ``1, 3, 6, 9, 16, 27``

   (*Hint* : You might find a ``while`` helpful here. Below is a very simple
   example that repeatedly adds  ``2``  to the variable  ``x``  until  ``x``
   is no longer less than 7.)

    ::

        x = 0
        while x < 7:
            x = x + 2
        print(x)

#. Use the  ``line``  command to plot the sequence for ``27``.

#. Write an  ``@interact``  function that takes an integer  `n`  and
   plots the sequence for  `n`.

Stopping Time
-------------

The number of steps it takes for a sequence to reach  `1`  is the
*stopping time* . For example, the stopping time of  `1`  is  `0`
and the stopping time of  `6`  is  `8`.

**Exercises**

#. Write a function that returns the stopping time of a poisitve integer
   `n`. Plot the stopping times for `1, 2, ..., 100` in a
   ``bar chart``.

   ::

       sage: # edit here

#. Find the number less than `1000` with the largest stopping time. What
   is its stopping time? Repeat this for `2000, 3000, ..., 10000`.

Extension to Complex Numbers
----------------------------

If `n` is odd, then `3n+1` is even. So we can instead consider the
`\frac{3n+1}{2}`-operator that maps `n` to `\frac{n}{2}`, if
`n` is even; and to `\frac{3n+1}{2}`, if `n` is odd.

**Exercises**

#. Implement the `\frac{3n+1}{2}`-operator.

   ::

#. Consider the following function.

   .. MATH::

       f(z)=\frac z 2 \cos^2\left(z \frac \pi 2 \right)+\frac{(3z+1)}{2}\sin^2\left(z \frac \pi 2 \right)

   Construct `f` as a symbolic function and use Sage to verify that
   `f(n) = T(n)` for all `1 \leq n \leq 1000`, where `T` is
   the `\frac{3n+1}{2}`-operator. Argue that `f` is a smooth
   extension of `T` to the complex plane.

#. Let `g(z)` be the complex function:

   .. MATH::

      g(z) = \frac{1}{4}(1 + 4z - (1 + 2z)\cos(\pi z))

   Construct `g` as a symbolic function, and show that `f` and
   `g` are equal. *Hint*: Explore the various methods for symbolic
   functions beginning with ``.trig_``.

   ::

#. Use the  ``complex_plot``  command to plot  ``g``  in the domain
   `x=-5,...,5` and `y=-5,...,5`.

   ::

#. Consider the composition `h_n(z) = (g \circ g \circ \cdots \circ g)`
   (where there are `n` copies of `g` in this composition). Use
   ``complex_plot`` and ``graphics_array`` to plot `h_1`, `h_2`,
   `h_3`, ..., `h_6` on the domain `x=1,...,5` and
   `y=-0.5,...,0.5`.

    (*Hint:*  To speed things up or control the precision of the computations,
    you may want to replace  ``pi`` in your equation with ``CDF.pi()``. Type
    ``CDF?`` and ``CDF.pi?`` for more information.)

#. Generate some *really nice* images of `h_n` that illustrate the
   fractal-like behaviour of `h_n`. (*Hint:* You may want to explore the
   ``plot_points`` and ``interpolation`` options for the ``complex_plot``
   command.)
