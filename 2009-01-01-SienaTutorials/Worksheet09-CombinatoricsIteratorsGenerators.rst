Iterators/Generators
--------------------

An  *iterator*  is an object that allows one to iterate through all the elements of a collection. Iterators have a  ``next()``  method that return the next element in the collection.


The Python command  ``iter``  returns an iterator from an object (the object itself must support iteration).


::

    sage: it = iter([1,2,3])
    sage: it
    <listiterator object at 0x35a3950>

.. end of output

::

    sage: it.next()
    1

.. end of output

::

    sage: it.next()
    2

.. end of output

::

    sage: it.next()
    3

.. end of output

::

    sage: it.next()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    StopIteration

.. end of output


A  *generator*  is a function that is used to define an iterator. Instead of  ``return``  statements, it has  ``yield``  statements (it cannot have both!). When the function encounters a  ``yield``  statement, the function pauses and returns that value to the user. It continues from where it left off when it is asked for the next value.

    ....:         yield b

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:


1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...


Find the sum of all the even\-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed four million.

Operations producing new combinatorial classes

Sage supports several ways of creating new combinatorial classes from objects.

.. end of output

::

    sage: S.list()
    [{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}]

.. end of output


::

    sage: S = SetPartitions(['a','b','c'])
    sage: S
    Set partitions of ['a', 'b', 'c']

.. end of output

::

    sage: S.list()
    [{{'a', 'c', 'b'}}, {{'c', 'b'}, {'a'}}, {{'c'}, {'a', 'b'}}, {{'a', 'c'}, {'b'}}, {{'c'}, {'b'}, {'a'}}]

Example: Vexillary involutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A  *vexillary involution*  is a permutation that:



 #. avoids the pattern 2143;

 #. is an involution (that is, :math:`p = p^{-1}`).


We can create the set of vexillary involutions of the set {1,2,3,4} in Sage by  *filtering*  the set of permutations of {1,2,3,4}.


::

    sage: def is_involution(p):
    ....:     return p == p.inverse()


.. end of output

::

    sage: P = Permutations(4, avoiding=[2,1,4,3]).filter(is_involution)
    sage: P
    Filtered sublass of Standard permutations of 4 avoiding [[2, 1, 4, 3]]

.. end of output

::

    sage: P.cardinality()
    9

.. end of output

::

    sage: P.list()
    [[1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 4, 3], [1, 3, 2, 4], [1, 4, 3, 2], [3, 4, 1, 2], [2, 1, 3, 4], [4, 2, 3, 1], [3, 2, 1, 4], [4, 3, 2, 1]]

.. end of output


::

    sage: def number_of_vexillary_involutions(n):
    ....:     P = Permutations(n, avoiding=[2,1,4,3]).filter(is_involution)
    ....:     return P.cardinality()


.. end of output

::

    sage: SL = sloane_find([number_of_vexillary_involutions(n) for n in range(1,7)])
    Searching Sloane's online database...

.. end of output

::

    sage: SL[0]
    [1006, 'Motzkin numbers: number of ways of drawing any number of nonintersecting chords joining n (labeled) points on a circle.', [1, 1, 2, 4, 9, 21, 51, 127, 323, 835, 2188, 5798, 15511, 41835, 113634, 310572, 853467, 2356779, 6536382, 18199284, 50852019, 142547559, 400763223, 1129760415, 3192727797, 9043402501, 25669818476, 73007772802, 208023278209, 593742784829]]

Defining your own Combinatorial Classes
---------------------------------------

.. WARNING::

   Combinatorial classes are now deprecated, and will disappear as soon as all
   derived classes in Sage's library will have been fixed.

If you want to work with a set of objects that is not defined in Sage, then you can use the object\-oriented features of Python/Sage to define a new class to model your set.


By inheriting from the  ``CombinatorialClass``  class, your object will behave like the objects we saw above ( ``Permutations(3)`` ,  ``Compositions(6)`` , etc.).


At the very minimum, you should implement the following methods:



 - ``__init__`` : takes as arguments what is needed to define the set;

 - ``__iter__`` : the algorithm to  ``iter`` ate through the elements of the set;

 - ``__repr__`` : (optional) a string  ``repr`` esentation of the set.

    ....:         for p in P:        
    ....:             yield p
    ....:

Exercise: Sums of subsets
-------------------------

(Inspired by  `Project Euler Problem 201 <http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=201>`_)

For any set :math:`A` of numbers, let :math:`\sigma(A)` be the sum of the
elements of :math:`A`.

Consider the set :math:`B = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4 \}`.
There are 6 subsets of :math:`B` of size :math:`2`:

.. MATH::
    \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{2, 4\}, \{3, 4\}

And the sums of the numbers in these subsets are

.. MATH::
   \sigma(\{1, 2\}) = 3 \\
   \sigma(\{1, 3\}) = 4 \\
   \sigma(\{1, 4\}) = 5 \\
   \sigma(\{2, 3\}) = 5 \\
   \sigma(\{2, 4\}) = 6 \\
   \sigma(\{3, 4\}) = 7 \\

Some of these sums occur more than once, others are unique. The set of unique
sums is :math:`\{3, 4, 6, 7\}`, and the sum of this set is :math:`\sigma(\{3,
4, 6, 7\}) = 20`.

**Exercises**

#. How many subsets of :math:`\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}` are there containing
   exactly 3 elements?  (*Hint:*  Use the ``Subsets`` command.)

   ::

       sage: # edit here

#. Use the ``union`` method to construct the subsets of
   :math:`\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}` that contain 3 or 5 elements. What is its
   cardinality?

   ::

       sage: # edit here

#. List all the subsets of :math:`\{1,3,6,8,10,11\}` of size three.

   ::

       sage: # edit here

#. Determine the sum of all integers that are the sum of exactly one of the
   3\-element subsets of :math:`\{1,3,6,8,10,11\}`.

   ::

       sage: # edit here

#. How many 12-element subsets of  :math:`\{1^2, 2^2, \dots, 24^2\}` are
   there? 

   ::

       sage: # edit here

#. Determine the sum of all integers that are the sum of exactly one of the
   12-element subsets of :math:`\{1^2, 2^2, \dots, 24^2\}`.

   ::

       sage: # edit here

.. pull-quote::

    **Remark.** The `Project Euler Problem 201
    <http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=201>`_  is to
    determine the sum of all the integers that are the sum of exactly one of
    the 50-element subsets of :math:`\{1^2, 2^2, \dots, 100^2\}`, and to do
    this in under two minutes of computation time!

Exercise: Derangements
----------------------

A  *fixed point*  of a permutation :math:`p` is an element :math:`i` such that
:math:`p(i) = i`. A  *derangement*  is a permutation that has no fixed points.

#. Define a function called  ``is_derangement``  that returns  ``True`` if
   :math:`p` is a derangement and returns  ``False``  otherwise.

   ::

       sage: # edit here

#. Use the  ``filter``  method of  ``Permutations``  to create a combinatorial
   class of all the derangements of ``[1,2,3,4]``, and list them.

   ::

       sage: # edit here

#. Create a list of the  *number*  of derangements of an :math:`n`-element
   set, for :math:`n = 1, 2, \dots, 7`.

   ::

       sage: # edit here

#. Visit the  `The On\-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
   <http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/>`_  webpage to find a fomula
   for the number of derangements of an :math:`n`-element set, and implement
   the function.

   ::

       sage: # edit here

Exercise: Vexillary involutions
-------------------------------

.. WARNING::

   Combinatorial classes are now deprecated, and will disappear as soon as all
   derived classes in Sage's library will have been fixed.

Using the  ``VexillaryInvolutions`` class above as a guide, create a class called  ``Derangements``  that inherits from  ``CombinatorialClass``  and implement the following methods.

 #. ``__init__(self, n):``  this method will take as argument a positive integer  ``n`` , and it will store the value in a data attribute for later access.

 #. ``__repr__(self):``  a string representation of the object. The command  ``Derangements(5)``  should print 'Derangements of a 5\-element set'.

 #. ``__iter__(self):``  implement a generator that iterates through all the derangements. ( *Hint:*  In the exercise above you used the  ``filter``  method to construct derangements; it is okay to use that here.)

 #. ``__contains__(self, p):``  implement a method that tests whether  ``p``  belongs to this combinatorial class (tests whether p is a derangement).

 #. ``cardinality(self):``  implement the method cardinality that returns the number of derangements. ( *Hint:*  You should have already implemented the function in the previous exercise.) ( *Remark:*  by default, this method iterates through the iterator to get the cardinality, which can be slow if the class contains a lot of elements.)
