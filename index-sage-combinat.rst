The Sage(-Combinat) Thematic Tutorials!
=======================================

This is an index, grouped by theme, of Sage(-Combinat) demonstrations,
quick reference cards, primers, and thematic tutorials, licensed under
a `Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License`__.

- A *demonstration* is a short document giving a broad view of the
  available features on a given theme; it is typically presented
  during a talk, and lasts a couple minutes.

- A *quickref* (or quick reference card) is a one page document with
  the essential examples, and pointers to the main entry points.

- A *primer* is a document meant for a user to get started by himself
  on a theme in a matter of minutes.

- A *tutorial* is more in-depth and could take as much as an hour or
  more to get through.

Some of them are part of the standard Sage distribution, including
tutorials that are part of a series developed for the MAA PREP
Workshop `Sage: Using Open-Source Mathematics Software with
Undergraduates <http:../prep/index.html>`_; others are under writing
by the Sage-Combinat community, and should eventually be integrated
into Sage. Finally, some are related to special events (workshops,
courses).
